    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Prepare the Stock</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken bones, pork bones, trotter, scallions, and ginger in a large stockpot; cover with cold water, noting water level in stockpot.</li>
        <li>ring to a rapid boil over high, skimming off and discarding any foam and scum that rises to the surface. Boil for at least 6 hours or up to 16 hours, replenishing water to original level every hour or so.</li>
        <li>Allow Stock to reduce without replenishment during final 1 hour of cooking, letting Stock reduce to roughly 2 quarts (this may take up to 2 hours)</li>
        <li>Remove Stock from heat; stir in kombu, and let cool at room temperature for about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Pour Stock through a coarse mesh strainer into a large bowl; then pour Stock through a fine mesh strainer into a separate large bowl, discarding solids. Cover and refrigerate until Stock is fully gelatinized, about 12 hours.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Prepare the Chashu</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a Dutch oven with a tight fitting lid over medium-high; add oil. Add pork, and sear until golden brown on at least 2 sides, about 3 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Transfer pork to a plate, and set aside. Reduce heat to medium; add garlic, scallions, ginger, and chile; cook, stirring often, until aromatic, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Carefully add mirin, sake, shoyu, rice wine vinegar, and brown sugar, stirring until sugar dissolves, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Return pork to Dutch oven, nestling it among ingredients. Bring mixture to a simmer over medium; reduce heat to medium-low. </li>
        <li>Cover Dutch oven tightly with lid; simmer pork, flipping and basting every 30 minutes, until pork is tender enough to easily yield to a poke from a chopstick and a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of pork registers 180°F, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>If a lot of cooking liquid evaporates during cooking process, add just enough water to keep bottom of Dutch oven covered. Let chashu cool in its cooking liquid at room temperature, about 1 hour; cover (still in its liquid) and refrigerate 12 hours.</li>
        <li>While chashu chills, prepare the Pickled Mushrooms: Bring water in a medium saucepan to a boil over high.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, and stir in mushrooms; cover and let soak until mushrooms are softened and doubled in size, 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Drain mushrooms, and thinly slice. Place mushrooms in a heatproof container.</li>
        <li>Bring rice wine vinegar, shoyu, water, and grated ginger to a boil in a small pot over high. </li>
        <li>Pour vinegar mixture over mushrooms, and let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate 12 hours.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Prepare the Ramen</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove Pickled Mushrooms from refrigerator, and let come to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare noodles according to package directions.</li>
        <li>While noodles cook, skim congealed fat from top of Stock using a spoon; reserve fat for another use. Place Stock in a medium pot, and bring to a simmer over medium. Add shoyu, mirin, rice wine vinegar, and sesame oil, stirring to combine; season with salt to taste. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until ready to serve.</li>
        <li>Remove chashu from cooking liquid, reserving liquid for another use. Cut pork into 1/4-inch slices. Working in 3 batches, heat a large skillet over medium-high; add 1 tablespoon of the oil. Place pork slices in a single layer in skillet, and cook until browned, about 1 minute per side; set aside.</li>
        <li>Add bok choy, cut side down, to skillet, and cook, undisturbed, until browned, about 1 minute. Add water; cover skillet, steaming bok choy until vibrant green and slightly softened, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Ladle about 2 cups of hot Stock into each of 4 warm bowls. Drain noodles, and divide evenly among each bowl, arranging noodles neatly. Gently arrange 2 bok choy halves in each bowl; fan 3 to 4 chashu slices on top of noodles. Top each bowl with about 1/4 cup Pickled Mushrooms and 1 egg; place 1 nori sheet behind toppings. Serve immediately with chile oil on the side, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
